# UnaryConverter

This program can either encode an ASCII string to unary code or vice versa.
An unary code replaces every 1 with 0 and every 0 with 00 from binary string.

How to use the converter:
1. Start the program in your terminal or in a code-editor
2. Choose either to encode or decode a message
3. Enter a message to encode/decode.
